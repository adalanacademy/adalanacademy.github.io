#### Economics

The scientific discipline of economics is, like sociology and other so-called social sciences, a result of the attempt of the emerging modern hegemony to justify the new power conditions as natural, empirically provable fact. This role was previously played by religion, but with the liberal, secular ideology rising to power, science had to be made to take over its function.

Economics has often been called “the dismal science” because of how inaccurate and seemingly disconnected from reality it is. Compared to sociology economics is much more easily revealed as a farce due to the fact that it deals with the material needs and wants of people, physical realities that can actually be quantified, measured and compared. A handful of cosmopolitan institutions including the IMF, the WEF, the BIS, the World Bank and the leading central banks exercise immense political power in order to create and maintain the conditions their economic science proclaims natural laws.

One of the key aspects of this hegemonic doctrine is to distort and obscure the role of money and credit. Many theorists have challenged the paradigm of classical economics, the most well-known of them Karl Marx. While Marx’ investigations of accumulation, labor-value and the socioeconomic relation of the capitalist production process remain a cornerstone of economic theory, he did not manage to refute or replace the classical paradigm as such. On the question of money and credit in particular he largely adopts the definition of Adam Smith.

The capitalist control over global production and markets seems to have reached its peak after the collapse of the Soviet union, but it has also lost its moral legitimacy as its promise of universal peace and prosperity has failed to materialize. Today even its shrewdest advocates recognize that its premise of continuous growth inevitably means destruction and extinction.

Due to their reliance on abstract axioms rather than physical reality, classical and neoclassical economics are unable to explain this dilemma, much less to provide a solution. The proposed fixes for the most part ignore the field of economy and amount to the imposition of more centralized authority in the hands of governments, central banks or other extra-national autocratic institutions. The supposedly unchangeable flaws of the economic system are used as an excuse to eradicate civil rights, accountability and any opposition to total state power.

We can fight this threat by studying, developing and implementing democratic economics, to accurately understand the macroeconomic reality, devise courses of action to build an effective and scalable counter-economy, and to engage in economic operations that  can sustain the movement and broaden its scope for initiative. We place a central focus on DeFi, decentralized blockchain-based finance, due to the vast array of tools it provides and enables to design monetary instruments, coordinate markets and organize complex economic systems.

Economic studies in the academy focus on macroeconomic and monetary theory, the study of financial and monetary instruments, research into markets and decentralized distribution systems, economic ethics and philosophy regarding, risk, trust, speculation and hedging, market analysis and token economics. It is an objective of the academy to develop and distribute education materials that give a comprehensible overview of economic history and counter-economic strategy and contribute to elaborating the paradigm of democratic economics.
