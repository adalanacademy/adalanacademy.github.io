  *in* Faust *by J.W. von Goethe*

We believe only in theory that proves itself through action. All of our studies therefore linked to practical steps and methods. The academy is an active community relying on the experiences of its students to grow and adapt. Our theories, strategies and tactics are tested in practice and discarded, revised or augmented accordingly. The common methodology of how to do this is the backbone of the academy.
