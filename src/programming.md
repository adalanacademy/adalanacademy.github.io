#### Programming

Programming or software engineering is still a recent technology. Contrary to most of the other great inventions of the 20th century, including computer hardware,
it was not pioneered by the military as much as by young students with a deep love of freedom and moral conviction – the hacker movement.
Compared to the megatechnics of early computers and other modern machinery software engineering requires virtually no resources besides the availability of the machine itself,
a supply of electricity, and the dedication and enthusiasm of the engineer. These attributes among others have made this technology much more resistant to capture by the state.
It also greatly relies on collaboration, mutual aid and the free sharing of information, which are attributes of technology that historically often enable people’s autonomy from state power.
While the production and maintenance of the hardware and infrastructure it relies upon is still almost exclusively controlled by monopolistic corporations relying on large-scale slave labor
to source the raw materials, software technology has managed to defend itself against total capture and libertarian philosophy is still strong among many of those who build it.
Because of this and also because it is a relatively new but massively influential development in society, it has a huge potential to disrupt the existing power structures and build democratic alternatives.

Programming studies in the academy focus on training beginners in Python and the Linux command line, and offering more advanced classes in Rust, cryptography and anonymous engineering.
The aim is to build digital infrastructure that is sovereign, antifragile and uncensorable and can effectively facilitate social functions such as communication, coordination, trade, finance, education and many others.

Unlike coder *bootcamps*, the academy is not focused on bringing students into the workforce where they can trade meaningless labor for comfortable salaries.
The academy encourages traits of creativity, curiosity, and self-motivation.

Prospective students can join with any amount of prior experience. From absolute beginner to professional. The academy maintains a general track:

1. Python and Linux foundations, start building your own programs and reading public code as well as familiarization with the free software ecosystem
2. Rust systems development, learn more advanced features of the language and build production-level software, contribute to open source projects, work in teams and cross-pollinate ideas
3. Specializations such as networking, cryptography, smart contracts, anonymity engineering, intelligent systems

A mentor will design a specific track for you or a group based on your personal goals and desired outcomes. All tracks will have an element of applied research, self-inquiry into personal objectives, and collaboration with others.

If you are interested in setting up a programming track, join the Adalan Telegram group [here](https://t.me/adalancommunity) and speak with the programming mentors.
