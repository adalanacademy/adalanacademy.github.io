# Welcome to Adalan Academy

We are software engineers, economists, inventors and philosophers. We are re-imagining education, moving away from dogmatism towards pragramatism and creativity, away from emphasis on constrained systems of thought and mass schooling toward meaningful relationships and development. We aim not just to achieve personal development and sovereignty for individuals but also communities. This is the cultural revolution to reclaim our sovereignty as peoples.
