# Welcome to Adalan Academy

We are a network of software enginners, economists, historians and philosophers. Capable and willing to share technical and business skills. Assit in moral, philosophical and spiritual development for those who are seeking sovereignty. We are re-imagining education, moving away from dogmatism towards pragramatism, away from emphasis on constrained systems of thought and mass schooling toward personal relationships and development. We aim not just to achieve personal development and sovereignty for individuals but also communities. This is the cultural revolution to reclaim our sovereignty as peoples.
